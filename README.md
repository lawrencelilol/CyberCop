App that help analyze Federal Trade Commission(FTC) cases


## 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a government agency that is responsible for "protecting consumers and competition by preventing anticompetitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitimate business activity." It conducts investigative cases against companies that engage in unlawful practices that harm consumers in any way. These cases are logged under [Cases and Proceedings](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings) and are available for public review.
